# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is in early development. Security fixes are provided on the `main` branch until versioning policy is formalized.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Please contact the maintainers with a clear subject line: "Security vulnerability report: WNC".
- Include details to reproduce the issue, affected versions, and potential impact.
- We aim to acknowledge within 72 hours and provide a timeline where possible.

Please do not open public issues for sensitive security reports.
